At first glance, one might think that the Pope does not have much impact on our everyday life and on our countryâ€™s politics, yet he influences over 1.3 billion Catholics worldwide and regularly meets with the most powerful political figures of the planet.  
Here, we want to investigate how one of the mightiest apolitical figures on Earth influences one sixth of the world population by using a novel quotations corpus : **Quotebank**.  

The main idea is therefore to try to situate the Pope on a political spectrum, here the American political system, using characteristics extracted from the corpus of his quotes. This will help us determine whether such an influential and, suposedly, non-political figure can be aligned with a certain political party or not.

## On what political spectrum can we try to place the Pope?
The political spectrum we choose to place the Pope on is the **American bipartite system** with on one end the Democratic Party and on the other the Republican Party. This spectrum is particularly suited to our analysis because the Quotebank corpus is in English and most of the quotes are extracted from American newspapers, thus a high number of quotations are from American politicians.  
This analysis is therefore divided into three groups: the ***Democrates***, the ***Republicans*** and the ***Pope***.  
Below is a summary table of the speakers chosen for each party.

| Political figure | Party      |Number of quotations |
|------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Elizabeth Warren | Democratic | 48'397               |
| Bernie Sanders   | Democratic | 84'018               |

## What are the most used lexical fields?
First, to investigate the Pope's position on the American political spectrum, it would be very meaningful to extract and analyse the most discussed topics by each party and by the Pope. A relevant way to do this is to study the most used lexical fields in the quotes of each speaker.  

Let's first take a look at all the the lexical field categories that are used by each group.
